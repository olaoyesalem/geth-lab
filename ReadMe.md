# Geth Learning Lab

A collection of Go code examples written while learning Ethereum development with Go-Ethereum (geth). This repository follows along with the [Go Ethereum Book](https://goethereumbook.org/) and contains implementations of various Ethereum interactions using the Go programming language.

## Purpose

This project serves as a learning environment for understanding:
- Go-Ethereum (geth) client interactions  
- Ethereum account management
- Smart contract deployment and interaction
- Transaction handling
- Block exploration
- Ethereum network interaction patterns
